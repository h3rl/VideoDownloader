# VideoDownloader
Download videos from any browser. Run the program, copy link of video you want to download and see the magic happen. When a video url is copied the video is added to the download queue. you may continue copying new urls for download while it is downloading another video.

#### Note
[ffmpeg](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases) is probably required to use this. download and extract to repo location.
